# VIBE CODING - FLOW STATE DEVELOPMENT

## MENTAL MODEL
- Code with intention and flow
- Aesthetic code that feels good to write
- Performance and beauty in harmony
- Intuitive component composition

## CODING RHYTHM
- Start with component interface
- Build from outside-in
- Test interactions immediately
- Refactor for elegance

## AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES
- Clean, readable code
- Consistent naming patterns
- Logical file organization
- Comments that add value

## FLOW STATE TRIGGERS
### Environment Setup
- Clean workspace
- Distraction-free coding
- Comfortable temperature
- Good lighting
- Favorite music (instrumental)

### Mental Preparation
1. **Clear Objective**: Define exactly what you're building
2. **Break Down**: Chunk into 25-minute sprints
3. **Visualize**: See the end result before coding
4. **Remove Friction**: Have all tools ready

## CODING MANTRAS
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- "Perfection is achieved when there's nothing left to remove"
- "Code is poetry in motion"
- "Every component tells a story"

## PRODUCTIVE CODING PATTERNS
### Component Creation Flow
1. **Interface First**: Define props and types
2. **Structure**: Create JSX skeleton
3. **Style**: Add Tailwind classes
4. **Behavior**: Add interactions
5. **Optimize**: Refactor and improve

### File Organization Zen
```
components/
├── ui/           # Pure UI components
├── sections/     # Page sections
├── common/       # Shared components
└── forms/        # Form components

utils/
├── helpers.ts    # Pure functions
├── constants.ts  # App constants
├── types.ts      # TypeScript types
└── hooks/        # Custom hooks
```

## AESTHETIC CODE PRINCIPLES
- **Meaningful Names**: Self-documenting code
- **Consistent Indentation**: Visual harmony
- **Logical Groupings**: Related code together
- **Whitespace Usage**: Breathing room for readability
- **Comment Philosophy**: Why, not what

## DEEP WORK TECHNIQUES
### Pomodoro for Developers
- 25min focused coding
- 5min break (walk, hydrate)
- After 4 cycles: 30min break
- Track progress visually

### Context Switching Minimization
- Batch similar tasks
- Use TODO comments for later
- Finish features completely
- Avoid notification during flow
